#### Team " in a flash "
 
# The Issues we are focussing 
* Voting in a specific area (vote booths)
* Privacy in homes (public places in general)

In this digital era people expect everything must comes at their door step . It may be groceries,foods,clothes and whatever
the main focus is they expect all this non-trivial things should at their door-step and it's happening . Then why a fundamental duty as voting can't be .Our idea is to make the voting process in home(preferablly closed) securely with the help of the AI and block chain.

### What are the issues that may arise while voting in a home ?

* Privacy 
* Verification

Our idea is that Voting can be done at smart phones since they contain finger-print reader as well as camera .
Consider each vote as a transaction between the voter and the leader (hopefully the elected one) which are noted on the public ledger no one can change anything in the ledger except the election commitee.

Voters can cast their vote from their smartphones they may connected to the election commision's vote portal.
Each vote can be verified by the voter's finger-print as digital signature .

Now during the vote casting process the voter may be surrounded by people thereby questioning their privacy.
So we are going to use the camera to sense the environment if any there are any person or any object to stalk their casting .
The voting can't be casted if there are being stakled . The smart phone will alert the voter and stop the casting process unitl the environment becomes safe.
The voter may recommended to cast their vote in closed room ( bath room works fine too )

### Technologies used:
* Face / Object detection using camera ===>  Using open CV
* voting verification ==> blcok chain environment (microsoft azure)
* voting portal ==> a progressive web app
