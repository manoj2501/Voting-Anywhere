In this digital era people expect aeverything must comes at their door step . It may be groceries,foods,clothes and whatever
the main focus is they expect all this non-trivial things should at their door-step and it's happening . Then why a fundamental 
duty as voting can't be .Our idea is to make the voting process in home securely with the help of the AI and block chain.

# What are the issues that may arise while voting in a home ?

* Privacy 
* Secur

Our idea is that Voting can be done at smart phones since they contain finger-print reader as well as camera .
Consider each vote as a transaction between the voter and the leader (hopefully the elected one) which are noted on the public ledger one can change anything in the ledger except the election commitee.

Voters can cast their vote from their smartphones they may connected to the election commision's vote portal.
Each vote can be verified by the voter's finger-print as digital signature .

Now during the vote casting process the voter may be surrounded by people thereby questioning their privacy
